# ArduinoLectures
#### A collection of my lectures/presentations on Arduino programming. ####

This repository hosts the lectures that I have given on Arduino programming, including specialized lectures on select topics. I apologize that they may have some content tailored to the original audience of the lecture. However, I am making these publicly available so that others may hopefully use them as a tool in their own learning of Arduino, with a few stipulations. If you present any of these lectures to another audience, please cite my name (Michael Benson) as the source of these slides. In addition, you absolutely may not use or present these slides for profit. That should be about it!

If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact me at michael.benson@protonmail.com (however, I recommend checking Google and Arduino's website first, as they know much more than I do!).


### Contents ###

`Introduction_To_Arduino.pdf` provides a gentle introduction to programming basics such as "What is a program?" and "What is an algorithm?", beginning techniques and syntax with Arduino, and a quick discussion of tools like flowcharts and finite state machines. It was originally presented in the course ME 5411: Mechatronics at Villanova University on February 1, 2017. It was also presented for a MATE seminar on February 4, 2017.

`Arduino Interrupts` provides an introduction to using pin and timer interrupts on the Arduino. It also includes sample Arduino code in the nested InterruptDemo folder, as well as a Matlab script that generates the plots in the accompanying slides. It was presented on February 9, 2019, at a MATE seminar.
